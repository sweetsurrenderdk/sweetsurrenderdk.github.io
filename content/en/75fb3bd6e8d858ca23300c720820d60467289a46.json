Because every profit made and all our tips are send directly to a worthy cause. Thankfully this common goal also makes us good friends and a happy bunch to be with at the same time.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"non-profit\">Non-profit</h3>\n\n<p>Over the course of time Caf&eacute; Sweet Surrender has donated all its profit to organisations that help people in a more direct way then we can.

And yes, you will be part of a group that plan the roster and makes sure every shift is covered.</p>\n\n<p>But you will also be the one that sees people blossom as you train them to be key stake holders in the staff. And you will be the one that brings a smile to a hard-working volunteer by handing them their birthday present from Caf&eacute; Sweet Surrender, and the gift card for taking three shifts a month.</p>\n\n<p>And you can sleep well at night, knowing that you used all your organisational and people skills to make our little project a better and happier place to be at.</p>\n"},"schemaId":"bb487498319208a9d37ff2b0df17ccf4a68e5f32"},{"value":{"text":"<h3 id=\"accounting\">Accounting</h3>\n\n<p>A good accountant never makes mistrakes... and that is why we need you on the team.
