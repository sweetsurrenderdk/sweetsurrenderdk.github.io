        text: "Most people would say that we are a children friendly, non-profit café that wants to give all its visitors a break from the turmoil of everyday life by serving high-standard coffee and tea, affordable and proper meal and a warm smile.\n\nBut we are also a group of warm hearted volunteers from all parts of the world, that work together to make the café the biggest hit possible. Because every profit made and all our tips are send directly to a worthy cause. Thankfully this common goal also makes us good friends and a happy bunch to be with at the same time.\n\n### Non-profit\n\nOver the course of time Café Sweet Surrender has donated all its profit to organisations that help people in a more direct way then we can. If you want to see who has benefited from our support, you can find a list here on the homepage. And if you want to help us help more people – just buy two coffees instead on one the next time you drop by.\n\n### What we believe in\n\nCafé Sweet Surrender was started by a group of people from Greve Free Church. The Christian world view of kindness and love to our next is still our driving force, and a cornerstone in our organisation."
